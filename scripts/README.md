# Scripts overview

Kept in `scripts/` (for daily use):
- `start_project.ps1` / `start_project.bat` / `start_servers.ps1`: Start API + web locally (localhost only).
- `run_project.bat`: Simple Windows launcher for API + web.
- `check_status.ps1`: Quick health check for API/web and running Node/Python processes.

Archived (rare/one-off) scripts live in `scripts/archive/` with their own README.
